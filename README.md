# 🎮 Benny - Tic Tac Toe  

Welcome to **Benny - Tic Tac Toe**, my very first **React project**!  
A fun, minimal, and interactive game built to sharpen my React skills ⚡  

---

## 🧠 About The Game
This is a simple **Tic Tac Toe** app built using React Hooks (`useState`).  
Two players take turns — **X** and **O** — and the game automatically detects the winner.  

🕹️ It’s smooth, clean, and super easy to restart when the battle gets heated 🔥

## ✨ Features
✅ Two-player gameplay (X vs O)  
✅ Detects the winner in real time  
✅ Reset / Restart button  
✅ Responsive and clean UI  
✅ Built fully with React functional components
